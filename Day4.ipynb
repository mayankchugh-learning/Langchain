In computer science and programming, tokens are used to represent individual elements, such as keywords, symbols, or identifiers, in a program's source code. They are also used in natural language processing to represent words or phrases in a text.\\n\\nVectors, on the other hand, refer to an ordered collection of values or elements. In mathematics and statistics, vectors are represented as arrays of numbers and are used to describe quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity and force. In computer science, vectors are used to represent data structures, such as arrays and lists, and are essential in machine learning and data analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, tokens are discrete units of information, while vectors are collections of values that can represent various quantities or data structures.\""

The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and considered as the \"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\" by the ICC. It is widely considered the pinnacle championship of the sport of cricket.\n",
      "The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\n",

The United Nations uses three definitions for what constitutes a city, as not all cities may be classified using the same criteria. Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions. The methodology of calculating GDP may differ between the studies and are widely based on projections and sometimes approximate estimations, notably for cities that are not within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

      "Summary: This is a list of U.S. states and territories by gross domestic product (GDP). This article presents the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and their nominal GDP at current prices.\n",
      "The data source for the list is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in 2022. The BEA defined GDP by state as \"the sum of value added from all industries in the state.\"Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.Overall, in the calendar year 2022, the United States' Nominal GDP at Current Prices totaled at $25.463 trillion, as compared to $23.315 trillion in 2021.\n",
      "The three U.S. states with the highest GDPs were California ($3.6 trillion), Texas ($2.356 trillion), and New York ($2.053 trillion). The three U.S. states with the lowest GDPs were Vermont ($40.6 billion), Wyoming ($47.4 billion), and Alaska ($63.6 billion).\n",
      "GDP per capita also varied widely throughout the United States in 2022, with New York ($105,226), Massachusetts ($99,274), and North Dakota ($96,461) recording the three highest GDP per capita figures in the U.S., while Mississippi ($47,572), Arkansas ($54,644), and West Virginia ($54,870) recorded the three lowest GDP per capita figures in the U.S. The District of Columbia, though, recorded a GDP per capita figure far higher than any U.S. state in 2022 at $242,853.\n",

      "Summary: The United States is a highly developed/advanced mixed economy. It is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP; it is also the second largest by purchasing power parity (PPP), behind China. It has the world's seventh highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the eighth highest per capita GDP (PPP) as of 2022. The U.S. accounted for 25.4% of the global economy in 2022 in nominal terms, and about 15.6% in PPP terms. The U.S. dollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and is the world's reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency.The American economy is fueled by high productivity, well developed transportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2021, they had the highest median household income. The U.S. has one of the world's highest income inequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea, Israel, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation.By 1890, the United States had overtaken the British \u001b[0m\n",
